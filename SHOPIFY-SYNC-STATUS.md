# Shopify Sync Status

## ✅ What's Complete

1. **Product Data**: All 22 products from Shopify are now in `src/app/products/data.ts`
   - Direct from `all-products.json` 
   - All variants, colors, sizes, prices
   - Full HTML descriptions
   - Proper image references

2. **Collections Data**: Already exists in `src/data/collections.ts`
   - Upperwear, Layers, Headwear, Bottoms
   - Proper slugs and images

3. **Image References**: All 344 images are mapped
   - Format: `/images/{product-handle}/{index}.jpg`
   - Example: `/images/modern-arab-faded-tee-black-print/0.jpg`

## 🚀 To Complete Setup

Run this single command to download ALL images (takes ~5 minutes):

```bash
cd /Users/josephsmith/CascadeProjects/modern-arab-apparel
./scripts/download-shopify-images-direct.sh
```

## 📱 Test Pages

- Product page: http://localhost:3000/products/modern-arab-faded-tee-black-print
- Collection page: http://localhost:3000/collections/upperwear
- Test page: http://localhost:3000/test-shopify
