# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will replace the current typewriter animation for Arabic text in the header with a handwritten animation that simulates the natural flow of Arabic calligraphy being written from right to left. The animation should feel organic and authentic, mimicking the way Arabic text is traditionally written by hand.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the website, I want to see the Arabic text in the header appear with a handwritten animation, so that it feels more authentic and culturally appropriate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the Arabic text SHALL animate with a handwritten effect from right to left
2. WHEN the handwriting animation completes THEN the text SHALL remain visible without any cursor or additional effects
3. WHEN the animation plays THEN it SHALL follow the natural stroke order of Arabic calligraphy
4. WHEN viewed on different screen sizes THEN the animation SHALL scale appropriately and remain readable

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the handwriting animation to be performant and accessible, so that it doesn't negatively impact user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the animation runs THEN it SHALL use hardware-accelerated CSS or SVG animations for smooth performance
2. WHEN users have reduced motion preferences THEN the system SHALL respect those preferences and show static text
3. WHEN the animation completes THEN it SHALL not consume ongoing resources or cause memory leaks
4. WHEN the page loads multiple times THEN the animation SHALL perform consistently

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the handwritten animation to be accessible, so that I can still understand the content regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN screen readers encounter the animated text THEN they SHALL read the complete text content
2. WHEN users have motion sensitivity THEN they SHALL have the option to see static text instead
3. WHEN the animation is in progress THEN the text content SHALL still be semantically available to assistive technologies
4. WHEN keyboard navigation is used THEN the animated element SHALL not interfere with focus management
