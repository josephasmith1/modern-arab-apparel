# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Modern Arab Apparel e-commerce website is experiencing multiple image loading failures across product collections. Console errors show 404 responses for various product variant images, particularly for hoodie, crewneck, and other apparel items. This is impacting user experience by showing broken images and failing color extraction functionality. The system needs a comprehensive solution to identify, map, and fix all broken image references while ensuring proper fallback mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer browsing products, I want all product images to load correctly so that I can see the actual appearance of items before purchasing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any product collection page THEN all product variant images SHALL load without 404 errors
2. WHEN a product has multiple color variants THEN each variant's main image SHALL be accessible and display correctly
3. IF a specific variant image is missing THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate fallback image
4. WHEN the color extraction system processes images THEN it SHALL not fail due to missing image files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want to identify all broken image references so that I can understand the scope of the image loading problem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running an image audit THEN the system SHALL identify all missing image files referenced in product data
2. WHEN analyzing image paths THEN the system SHALL detect inconsistencies between expected and actual file locations
3. WHEN checking product variants THEN the system SHALL report which specific color/size combinations have missing images
4. WHEN generating a report THEN the system SHALL provide actionable information about each missing image

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically map existing images to correct product variants so that manual fixing is minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning available images THEN the system SHALL match them to product variants based on naming patterns
2. WHEN finding similar image names THEN the system SHALL suggest correct mappings for broken references
3. IF multiple potential matches exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize based on naming conventions and folder structure
4. WHEN updating image references THEN the system SHALL preserve the original data structure and format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer, I want consistent image loading performance so that the site feels professional and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are loading THEN the system SHALL implement proper loading states and error handling
2. WHEN an image fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a placeholder that maintains layout integrity
3. WHEN color extraction fails THEN the system SHALL use default colors without breaking the UI
4. WHEN browsing different product variants THEN image transitions SHALL be smooth and consistent

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a site maintainer, I want automated validation to prevent future image loading issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new product data is added THEN the system SHALL validate that referenced images exist
2. WHEN images are updated THEN the system SHALL verify all references are still valid
3. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with specific file paths
4. WHEN running periodic checks THEN the system SHALL report any newly broken image references
